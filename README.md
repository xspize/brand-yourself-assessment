## Digital Creativity Assessment

A brand needs to have its own identity, be recognizable just from a glance. To use those concepts I started by following important steps until I reach what I intended.

## First step - Research

When it comes to researching for ideas to create a logo, there is a whole lot of countless brands to take inspiration from. What I am aiming for is to assimilate a name to an image/shape that is memorable to the user. Some companies already perfectly do these. Lets take **Twitter** as an example, **Twitter** is often associated with a bird, why? because of its very recognizable logo. If one day they decided to change it, users would get very confused since the bird is the company identity.

To get started with the research to design the logo, I accessed a couple of websites that gave me a variety of ideas to all kinds of shapes that I could possibly use.
I started drawing some sketches with a notebook without having any idea of what I should aim for.

 __Twitter__ changed its identity throughout the years, it first added the symbolic bird in 2010. That change cannot be taken lightly. Since the company decided to change the designed logo the user growth was very noticeable.
 
A lot of brainstorming was necessary to find a fitting name for a Digital Design company. That was until I associated what exactly a digital designer is with an already existent word. And that being __Odyssey__ , honestly, as a designer, we always wander through our thoughts to expand our ideas to satisfy our customers, the word itself is very memorable and usually associated with going on adventures, which can possibly also be one of the slogans for the company. Having the name chosen that will then lead to the second step.

## Second Step -  Typography
