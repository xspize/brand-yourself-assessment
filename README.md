## Digital Creativity Assessment

A brand needs to have its own identity, be recognizable just from a glance. To use those concepts I started by following important steps until I reach what I intended.

## Research

When it comes to researching for ideas to create a logo, there is a whole lot of countless brands to take inspiration from. What I am aiming for is to assimilate a name to an image/shape that is memorable to the user. Some companies already perfectly do these. Let's take **Twitter** as an example, **Twitter** is often associated with a bird, why? because of its very recognizable logo. If one day they decided to change it, users would get very confused since the bird is the company identity.

A lot of brainstorming was necessary to find a fitting name for a Digital Design company. That was until I associated what exactly a digital designer is with an already existent word. And that being __Odyssey__, honestly, as a designer, we always wander through our thoughts to expand our ideas to satisfy our customers, the word itself is very memorable and usually associated with going on adventures, which can also be one of the slogans for the company. 

After thinking of a name for the company, I got ideas from (Airey, “The Logo Design Idea Book, by Steven Heller and Gail Anderson”) and (Airey, “LoCoS Visual Language, by Professor Yukio Ota | Logo Design Love”) to  give me an insight of various types of shapes I could go for.
I started creating various sketches with a notebook using some of the shapes I found on that website.

Since the name of the company will be Odyssey I wanted the logo to have something to do with going on an adventure, traveling of some kind, but not too much because this is supposed to be a digital designer company, not a travel agency.

I used Adobe XD to transform those sketches into real designs using the pen tool.

## Typography
I am using two different fonts for the logo. for ODYSSEY I use a free font made by Tom Anders called __Anders__. (Behance)
And for "DIGITAL DESIGN" which are the words underneath ODYSSEY I use a free font called __XXII Aven__ made by Doubletwo studios. (doubletwo)
Both of those fonts can be used for both professional and personal.
I made the decision of using those fonts before I started working in Adobe XD. I wanted to make sure I found the right fonts to work with before starting anything else.

## Choosing the right logo

- ### Sample 1: 
The shape of the boat does not look quite right but in general, I like the idea of having a boat, it makes sense to have a boat as a logo of a company called Odyssey but it doesn't look very professional. I could adjust it to make it look better, but compared to the other samples I took upon the decision of discarding this sample.

- ### Sample 2: 
This sample is one of my favorites. I tried to include the letters D and Y inside the triangles but it didn't look too good and made me discard this sample.

- ### Sample 3: 
When it comes to having a familiar logo that has something to do with the name of the company itself, this logo is pretty much the letter [O] of Odyssey shown in a huge font size along with the brand name underneath. At first, I thought of having Dyssey and have the [ O ] standing on top of it, but that could lead to misunderstandings of what the company is called.

- ### Sample 4: 
Waves look good but, it looks a little too dull. I created the following samples after this one with those waves in mind which helped me quite a lot to reach something that I liked.

- ### Sample 5: 
As stated in Sample 4 I had those waves in mind for this sample, it's a circle with the waves inside it. Why a circle? well, once I took another look at sample 3 with the O in separate as a whole logo it came to my mind, why not include 3 initials inside it? so the circle symbolize the O and then inside the letters D and Y. Basically what I tried doing with the triangles but it looks way better in a circle.

- ### Sample 6: 
I started thinking about colouring the logo when I started drawing the sketch for this sample, because I wanted my logo to have colours. And that is why I used one of the lines of the waves I used in Sample 4 and 5. And in the middle the letters D and Y. That leaves me with a lot of possibilities to colour each side of the circle. Which is good and made me feel more confident about my project. I saved this sample as an SVG image and imported it to Adobe Illustrator.

<p>
   
<br />

## Creating the Logo (Sample 6) in Illustrator
After choosing the right Sample previously made in Adobe XD, I then saved the file as an svg image to edit it in Illustrator.
The first thing I did was to hold shift and created the shape of a circle. In a purple tone.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/step_1.png?raw=true">
</p>

Afterwards with the pen tool, I created a shape to simulate a wave that went across the middle of the circle. I managed to do this by subtracting the layer. I chose a darker colour to contrast the purple tone, I will later on, test more colours but for now, I'm creating the initial shape for the actual logo.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/step_2.png?raw=true">
</p>

And then I added the letters D and Y inside the circle. As a matter of design I had the idea of making them have colour from opposite sides of the circle. Since the circle will have 2 different colours, the letters could benefit of using the colour of the opposite sides.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/step_3.png?raw=true">
</p>

After having the logo in position with everything needed inside it. I then wrote the name of the company underneath it. Using the font __Anders__ as previously shown, size 49. I decided to highlight the initial letters ODY due to having them displayed in the logo itself. It looks good in terms of design. Underneath the words Odyssey I added Digital Design because I want people to see what the company is about. For this I use the font __Aven Bold__, size 11.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/step_4.png?raw=true">
</p>

To wrap it up, I wanted to add something else underneath the words Odyssey to not let the Digital Design part too empty. For this, I thought of 2 options. One of them was to draw a line from the O till the second S until it reached the words Digital Design, and the other idea was to also draw a line but with Digital Design being in the center.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/step_5.png?raw=true">
</p>

Digital Design displayed in the center:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/step_6.png?raw=true">
</p>
<p>
Upon those 2 options, I decided to include them both in the final output.
<p>
Once the logo was created and all set up, I can now finally start testing out different shades of colouring.

<p>
When I was creating the logo in fully black I decided to not include the wave inside the circle and just add the letters. In reality, there is no D and Y because I cropped those to include them in the circle otherwise using the colour white is not an option and would not work.

</p>
<p>
To start deciding on which colours I should use, I went to the website colorpallettes (colorpalettes, “Color Palette Ideas | ColorPalettes.Net”) and started looking for 2 warm colours that match each other to try them out on my logo.
<p>
<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
<p>
After making 3 warm samples of the logo I then started looking for cooler colours to see which one fits the best.

</p>
<p>
I decided to choose 4 colours for the main logo that can be used for different occasions. (Shades of dull Pink with Green #4071, Bright Blue and Gray #4138, Shades of Gray #4194, Brown and Light Gray #4093) they will be the official and final outputs for my design in which I'll showcase in my portfolio.
<p>
To display my work in Behance I will be using Photoshop with artboards to have all pages in one document to make it easier to organize everything.
<p>
  <p>
   
<br />
<p>
    
<br />

## First Image Output

<p>
For the first image, I will leave it simple by having the logo displayed with the background. I'm using the function "Drop Shadow" to create shadows that distinguish the logo and make it more noticeable.
For the background, I did some testing with textures and line patterns but instead, I decided to draw a line and turn the shape into a wave and place it in the middle to make an effect similar to what the circle in the logo has. The idea is to connect all pages.

<p align="center">

<p>
  
## Second Image Output

<p>
In the second image, I will show the slogan made for the brand. This slogan was initially made for the landing page but since I liked how it sounded I used it for this page and I think it fits well with the rest of the project. I wanted both pages to connect, for that, I made a similar line transformed into a wave and filled it with the colour white,  and decreased the opacity to 2%.

</p>

<p>
  
## Third Image Output

<p>

I chose the typography image to be in the third image. This image is very straightforward. It has the name of both fonts used and examples of how they look when used. Instead of inserting another line transformed into a wave I made a different shape and put it on the right side of the image to connect it with the previous one. All the other images will have this shape except for the 3 last ones. (Visual Identity Style Guide 1/4)

</p>

<p>
  
## Fourth Image Output

<p>

This image shows the 4 official colours made for the company and also the 2 possible designs that can be used. either with the words digital design centered or on the right side followed by a line. (Visual Identity Style Guide 2/4)

  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/image4.jpg?raw=true">
</p>
<p>
  
## Fifth Image Output

<p>

This image shows 3 examples of what you should NOT do with the logo. I have also included the right usage of the logo in which there are 2 design outputs and 4 colours as shown in the image before this one. (Visual Identity Style Guide 3/4)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/image5.jpg?raw=true">
</p>
<p>
  
## Sixth Image Output

<p>

In this image, I show the clear space of the logo. This is approximately 20% of the size of the logo. (Visual Identity Style Guide 4/4)

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/image6.jpg?raw=true">
</p>
<p>
  
## Seventh Image Output

<p>

For this image, I insert the black only logo on a white canvas to showcase how the logo in fully black looks on a white sheet. On the right side, I also added the normal logo to show the difference between them.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/image7.jpg?raw=true">
</p>

<p>
  
## Eighth Image Output

<p>

For this page, I use once again the black version of the logo on a white A4 mockup notepad. (“Corporate Identity Mockup - Mockups Design | Free Premium Mockups”)
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/image8.jpg?raw=true">
</p>
<p>
  
## Ninth Image Output

<p>

This page shows the business cards made for the company. I decided to use the wave effect on both sides to match it with the wave effect inside the circle of the logo. To show the business cards I used a mockup (“Corporate Identity Mockup - Mockups Design | Free Premium Mockups”) and on the right side the 85x55 sized cards.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/image9.jpg?raw=true">
</p>

<p>
  
## Tenth Image Output

<p>

I used a mockup MacBook (“Free MacBook Pro Mockup - Mockups Design | Free Premium Mockups”) to show the landing page of the company. Inside the landing page, I use an image made by (Seitamaa) I added the slogan of the company on top of that image on which was used to display a slider in the landing page.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/xspize/xspize/blob/main/pictures/image10.jpg?raw=true">
</p>

<p>
  
## Eleventh Image Output

<p>
For the final image, I use a mockup made by (“Free IPhone 11 Pro Mockup - Mockups Design | Free Premium Mockups”) in which I only show the logo with a mirrored effect.

<p>

## Behance
<p>
After completing the design outputs I exported all artboards with a jpeg format. I then uploaded everything to my Behance Portfolio.
<p>
I am using a content spacing of 0px to make all the images connect.
