## Digital Creativity Assessment

A brand needs to have its own identity, be recognizable just from a glance. To use those concepts I started by following important steps until I reach what I intended.

## Research

When it comes to researching for ideas to create a logo, there is a whole lot of countless brands to take inspiration from. What I am aiming for is to assimilate a name to an image/shape that is memorable to the user. Some companies already perfectly do these. Lets take **Twitter** as an example, **Twitter** is often associated with a bird, why? because of its very recognizable logo. If one day they decided to change it, users would get very confused since the bird is the company identity.

A lot of brainstorming was necessary to find a fitting name for a Digital Design company. That was until I associated what exactly a digital designer is with an already existent word. And that being __Odyssey__ , honestly, as a designer, we always wander through our thoughts to expand our ideas to satisfy our customers, the word itself is very memorable and usually associated with going on adventures, which can possibly also be one of the slogans for the company. 

After thinking of a name for the company, I accessed a couple of websites that gave me a variety of ideas for all kinds of shapes that I could possibly use for the logo.
I then started doing sketches with a notebook without having much of an idea of what shape I should use.

Since the name of the company will be Odyssey I wanted the logo to have something to do with going on an adventure, traveling of some kind, but not too much because this is supposed to be a digital designer company not a travel agency.

I used Adobe XD to transform those sketches into real designs to also gather some feedback from other people to reach a final conclusion on which one I should use.
